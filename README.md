Welcome!

This is just a quick rundown of what each of the programs here do/which ones work:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

corefresolution.py: This program shows references to an object using lists. It also returns the input text given with the pronouns all replaced by the nouns they are referring to.

nltktestcont.py: This program summarizes input, it specifically gives the user the following details: The preamble, the components, the functionality of those components, and the scores that sentences get.

scratchnltktest.py: This program is just a worse version of "nltktestcont.py"

spacydisplaytest.py: This program generates a dependency graph that includes word dependencies and parts of speech. This graph is hosted at localhost:5000.

spacynltkdependencytest.py: In progress

spacysimilarity.py: Uses a SpaCy model to come up with a similarity score (I think cosine similarity)

test4.py: Work in progress

youtubetest.py: Uses a pretrained BART model to summarize text.
